cd comics-now
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy the example configuration:
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

4. Edit `config.json` with your settings (see Configuration below)

5. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to configure the application:

### Basic Settings

- **port**: Port number for the server (default: 3000)
- **baseUrl**: Base URL path for the application (e.g., `/comics` or `/`)
- **comictaggerPath**: Path to ComicTagger executable
- **comicsLocation**: Main directory containing your comics
- **comicsDirectories**: Array of directories to scan for comics

### CORS Settings

```json
"cors": {
  "enabled": true,
  "allowedOrigins": [
    "https://your-domain.com",
    "http://localhost:3000"
  ]
}
```

### Authentication (Optional)

Comics Now supports Cloudflare Zero Trust authentication for secure multi-user access.

```json
"authentication": {
  "enabled": false,
  "adminEmail": "admin@example.com",
  "cloudflare": {
    "teamDomain": "yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com",
    "audience": "your-application-audience-tag"
  },
  "trustedIPs": [
    "127.0.0.1",
    "::1",
    "192.168.1.*"
  ]
}
```

**Authentication Options:**

- **enabled**: Set to `true` to enable authentication, `false` to disable
- **adminEmail**: Email address of the administrator user
- **cloudflare.teamDomain**: Your Cloudflare Zero Trust team domain
- **cloudflare.audience**: Application Audience (AUD) tag from Cloudflare Access
- **trustedIPs**: Array of IP addresses/patterns that bypass authentication
  - Supports wildcards (e.g., `192.168.1.*` matches all IPs in that subnet)
  - Useful for local network access without authentication

## Setting up Cloudflare Zero Trust Authentication

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- A domain managed by Cloudflare
- Comics Now installed and running

### Step 1: Enable Cloudflare Zero Trust

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Navigate to **Zero Trust** in the sidebar
3. If first time, complete the Zero Trust onboarding
4. Note your **Team Domain** (e.g., `yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com`)

### Step 2: Create an Access Application

1. In Zero Trust dashboard, go to **Access** ‚Üí **Applications**
2. Click **Add an application**
3. Select **Self-hosted** application type
4. Configure the application:

   **Application Configuration:**
   - **Application name**: `Comics Now` (or your preferred name)
   - **Session Duration**: Choose your preferred session length (e.g., 24 hours)
   - **Application domain**:
     - Subdomain: `comics` (or your subdomain)
     - Domain: Select your domain from dropdown
     - Path: Leave blank or specify your baseUrl (e.g., `/comics`)

   **Identity Providers:**
   - Add at least one identity provider (Google, GitHub, email OTP, etc.)
   - Click **Next**

   **Policies:**
   - Create a policy to control who can access
   - Example policy: "Allow specific email addresses"
     - Policy name: `Allow Admin`
     - Action: `Allow`
     - Configure rules:
       - Selector: `Emails`
       - Value: Your email address
   - Add more policies as needed for additional users
   - Click **Next**

5. Review and click **Add application**

### Step 3: Get Application Credentials

1. In your application settings, find the **Application Audience (AUD) Tag**
   - Located in **Overview** tab of your application
   - Looks like: `abc123def456...` (long hexadecimal string)
   - Copy this value

2. Your **Team Domain** is shown in the Zero Trust dashboard
   - Format: `yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com`
   - Found in **Settings** ‚Üí **Custom Pages** or in the application URL

### Step 4: Configure Comics Now

Edit your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "authentication": {
    "enabled": true,
    "adminEmail": "your-admin-email@example.com",
    "cloudflare": {
      "teamDomain": "yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com",
      "audience": "your-application-audience-tag-here"
    },
    "trustedIPs": [
      "127.0.0.1",
      "::1"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Configuration Notes:**
- `adminEmail`: This email will have admin privileges (must match one of your Cloudflare Access allowed emails)
- `teamDomain`: Your Cloudflare Zero Trust team domain
- `audience`: The Application Audience (AUD) tag from Step 3
- `trustedIPs`: Optional - IPs that can bypass Cloudflare authentication (useful for local network)

### Step 5: Test Authentication

1. Restart Comics Now:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or if using systemd
   sudo systemctl restart comics-now
   ```

2. Access your application through the Cloudflare domain:
   ```
   https://comics.yourdomain.com
   ```

3. You should see the Cloudflare Access login page
4. Log in with your configured identity provider
5. After successful login, you'll be redirected to Comics Now

### Step 6: Add Additional Users

1. Go to Cloudflare Zero Trust ‚Üí **Access** ‚Üí **Applications**
2. Click on your Comics Now application
3. Go to **Policies** tab
4. Edit existing policy or create new policy:
   - **For regular users**: Add their email to an "Allow Users" policy
   - **For admins**: Add their email to `adminEmail` in `config.json`

**User Roles:**
- **Admin**: Full access to all features (ComicTagger, settings, user management, etc.)
- **User**: Can read comics and manage their own progress/devices

### Troubleshooting

**Login redirects to wrong URL:**
- Check your `baseUrl` in `config.json` matches your Cloudflare application path
- Ensure your application domain is correctly configured in Cloudflare

**"Invalid authentication token" error:**
- Verify your `audience` tag is correct
- Check your `teamDomain` matches your Zero Trust team domain
- Ensure Cloudflare Access application is enabled

**Local access not working:**
- Add your local network IPs to `trustedIPs` array
- Use wildcards for subnets: `192.168.1.*`
- Trusted IPs bypass Cloudflare authentication entirely

**Users can't access certain features:**
- Check if user's email matches `adminEmail` in config (for admin access)
- Regular users have read-only access to most features

### Advanced: Trusted IPs

If you want to allow local network access without Cloudflare authentication:

```json
"trustedIPs": [
  "127.0.0.1",           // Localhost
  "::1",                 // IPv6 localhost
  "192.168.1.*",         // All IPs in 192.168.1.x subnet
  "10.0.0.5"             // Specific IP address
]
```

**Security Note:** Trusted IPs bypass ALL authentication. Only use for secure local networks.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables as an alternative to configuration file settings:

- **PORT**: Server port (overrides `config.json`)
- **NODE_ENV**: Set to `development` for development mode
- **CF_TEAM_DOMAIN**: Cloudflare team domain (fallback if not in config)
- **CF_AUDIENCE**: Cloudflare audience tag (fallback if not in config)

Example:
```bash
PORT=8080 NODE_ENV=production npm start
```
